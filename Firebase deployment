To deploy your Firebase Contact Book project, follow these steps:

1. First, Install Firebase Tools
If you haven't already, install the Firebase CLI globally:

npm install -g firebase-tools

2. Log in to Firebase:
firebase login
This will open a browser window for authentication.

3. Initialize Firebase in Your Project:

firebase init
You'll be prompted to:

Select Firebase features (enable Hosting and/or Firestore if needed)

Choose your Firebase project or create a new one

Specify your public directory (usually dist/contact-book-fb for Angular)

Configure as a single-page app (choose Yes for Angular)

4. Build Your Angular Project:
ng build --configuration production
This creates production-ready files in the dist folder.

5. Deploy to Firebase:
firebase deploy
Or deploy only hosting:
firebase deploy --only hosting

Expected Output
=== Deploying to 'your-project-id'...

i  deploying hosting
i  hosting: preparing dist/contact-book-fb directory for upload...
✔  hosting: files uploaded successfully
✔  hosting: deploy complete!

✔  Deploy complete!

Project Console: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/your-project-id/overview
Hosting URL: https://your-project-id.web.app



Troubleshooting
"Firebase command not found" → Reinstall Firebase CLI (npm install -g firebase-tools)

Deployment errors → Check firebase.json configuration

404 errors after deploy → Ensure your public directory in firebase.json points to the correct build folder
